### An almost sorted array is given to us and the task is to sort that array completely. Then,which sorting algorithm would you prefer and why?

- Insertion would be the preferred algorithm if the array is almost sorted, as because it can sort that array in O(n) time and with O(1) space, where as other algos would take a minimum of O(n log n).
